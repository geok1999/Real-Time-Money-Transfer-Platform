# 💸 Real-Time Money Transfer Platform

A secure, scalable, and real-time money transfer application built using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **Apache Kafka**. This project is designed to demonstrate a robust, modern architecture with support for JWT-based security, real-time event streaming, and rich transaction features.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a full-fledged backend system that allows users to:
- Transfer money in real-time.
- Securely manage their accounts.
- Monitor transactions with real-time analytics.
- Handle multiple currencies with conversion support.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Security**: Spring Security with JWT
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or any relational DB with JPA/Hibernate)
- **Messaging & Streaming**: Apache Kafka, Kafka Streams
- **Monitoring**: Micrometer + Prometheus/Grafana (optional)

---

## 🧱 Key Features & Enhancements

### 🔐 Security
- JWT-based authentication and authorization.
- Role-based access control for secure endpoint protection.

### ⚡ Real-Time Processing with Kafka
- Kafka-powered event-driven architecture for transaction processing.
- Kafka Streams to analyze transaction patterns in real-time (e.g., fraud detection).

### 🧰 Additional Functionalities
- Full account management: create, update, delete accounts.
- Detailed transaction history and audit logs.
- Support for currency conversion across multiple currencies.

### Module Descriptions

- **API Layer**: Exposes RESTful endpoints to the outside world.
- **Service Layer**: Houses the core business logic.
- **Persistence Layer**: Manages database interactions using Spring Data JPA.
- **Security Module**: Handles JWT token generation, verification, and endpoint protection.
- **Kafka Module**: Handles publishing and consuming of transaction events, as well as stream processing for real-time insights.

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### ✅ Step 1: Project Setup
- Initialize a Spring Boot project with dependencies: `spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`, `spring-boot-starter-security`, `spring-kafka`, `kafka-streams`.
- Configure PostgreSQL (or other DB) with Spring Data JPA.
- Create basic `Account` and `Transaction` entities.

### 🔐 Step 2: Implement Security
- Set up Spring Security with JWT support.
- Define user roles (`ADMIN`, `USER`) and secure APIs using role-based access.
- Implement login endpoint to issue tokens.

### 📦 Step 3: Integrate Kafka
- Create Kafka topics for:
  - `transaction-events`
  - `account-events`
- Create Kafka producers to publish events after transactions or account changes.
- Implement Kafka consumers to react to incoming events (e.g., store audit logs, notify users).

### 🧠 Step 4: Implement Kafka Streams
- Build real-time stream processors:
  - Detect fraud patterns.
  - Monitor abnormal spikes or repeated failed transactions.
- Optionally expose analytics through a monitoring API or dashboard.

### 🔧 Step 5: Enhance Functionalities
- Implement account management endpoints:
  - `POST /accounts`, `PUT /accounts/{id}`, `DELETE /accounts/{id}`
- Add transaction history retrieval:
  - Filter by date range, transaction type, amount range, etc.
- Integrate a currency conversion API or library for real-time conversions.

### 🧪 Step 6: Testing & Monitoring
- Write **unit tests** for all business logic.
- Add **integration tests** for Kafka messaging and REST endpoints.
- Set up monitoring for:
  - Kafka throughput and lag
  - Application metrics via Actuator, Micrometer, Prometheus, etc.
